# linux_Text_Editors
a project on Linux text editors

The first linux text editor we would be working with is called the Vim. it is a versatile and very powerful linux text editor and ti get this running, the command to use is the "vim blank.txt". this automatically creates the file caled blank.txt and then opens the text editor for us to add content to it. 

below is the pictoral explanation of the above statements.

if i intend to delete a line, all i have to do is to click on the 'esc' key and then click on 'd' twice as this would delete the full line. the next thing to dois to save. the way of saving on the Vim text editor is done by escapong out of the insert part and then clicking on ':wq' as this would save it and immediately take us back to the termkinal and to be able to exit without saving, this is done by using ':q!' as this would quit the text editor immediately and return us back to the terminal. it is worthy to note that to create a file and edit on the vim text editor, this iis done by typing vim and the name you intend to give the file and it will immediatly open.
